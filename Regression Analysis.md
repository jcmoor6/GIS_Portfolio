Title: Observing the Distribution of Caribbean Porites Corals Based on Bathymetry, Chlorophyll Concentrations, and Sea Surface Temperature
Link: https://arcg.is/0H4bOK

Summary: This project was done to better understand coral distribution by using an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression
analysis to determine if SST, chlorophyll and bathymetry are good predictors of the distribution of Porites corals in the Caribbean.
